 2HELP TITLE / SURNAMES0

 2--- General ---0

 Titles are a brief decsriptory field placed before a user's name.  Surnames
are like Titles but follow the name. Some BBS's do not use titles / surnames.
Some allow only the SysOps to change them, and other boards allow any user 
to change thier own surname.  The surname is not part of the user name, 
but simply a displayed field.

 .ES  -- Enter Title / Surname

 This command will allow you to enter a surname on some DragCits.  Or
it may tell you "-- Users cannot enter thier own surnames".  To get a
surname there, you must ask the SysOp for one.  Some systems have no
surnames at all.
