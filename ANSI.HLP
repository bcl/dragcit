 2HELP ANSI0
  
 ANSI suport is curently very limited. (fair warning)
 
 ANSI can be turned on and off with the '~' key. If your terminal does not 
support ANSI this will cause garbage to be displayed, at least, and can
really confuse your terminal. What it will do is make room prompts inverse,
message headers bold (if your system does bold, mostly only mono systems
and DragCit in dial out mode do) and let you see diffrent colors in the
messages that users have inserted using DragCit's special ESC sequences
(the reason for these is for support of more terminals latter.)
 
 The Escape sequence starts with a CTRL-A and then a number (currently 0-4).
 These will give you diffrent special effects for your text.
 
 What it does:                              What it looks like:

 0 -- NORMAL                                0Normal0
 1 -- BLINK                                 1Blinking0
 2 -- REVERSE (inverse)                     2Inverted0
 3 -- BOLD                                  3Boldface0
 4 -- UNDERLINE                             4Underline0
 
 0, 2, and 1 seem to work for everyone. 3 for the systems mentiond above, and 
4 for mono remote systems and some mono local systems.
 The BOLD and UNDERLINE can cause problems with Color displays.
