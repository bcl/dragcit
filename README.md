Starting with the Gremlin's code, Peter added many features including
networking. For several years, almost all Seattle area Citadels ran this
program. When Peter started to release source code, many offshoots were
born.

There were two main source releases: 3.11 and 3.12. Most offshoots were
derived from 3.11 code. However, Gremlin's Citadel, Captain's Citadel,
and Maven's Citadel were derived from 3.12. TurboCit was derived from an
earlier version of the source.
